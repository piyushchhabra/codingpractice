1. Serialize and deserialize a binary tree

2. Given a 1-d array candy crush, return the shortest array after removing all the continuous same numbers (the repeating number >= 3)
   input: 1-d array [1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1]
   return: [1, 1]
   another testcase:
   [3,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,2,3,1,1,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,3] should return [3,1,3,2,3]
   Time complexity should be better than O(n^2)

3. Given 2 strings s and t, determine if you can convert s into t. The rules are:
   * You can change 1 letter at a time.
   * Once you changed a letter you have to change all occurrences of that letter.
